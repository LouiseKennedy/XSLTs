# XSLTs

XSL transformations used to edit metadata in preparation for ingest into a digital repository. 

The metadata is edited to conform to the guidelines for depositing objects in the Digital Repository of Ireland, and according to internally chosen practices at Dublin City Library and Archive, Ireland. 

The workflow had two stages:

1. Extract Dublin Core metadata from existing xml metadata records. 
2. Edit metadata to ensure validation against the Digital Repository of Ireland's schema (in order to enable batch ingest).
